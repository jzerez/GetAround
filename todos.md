* Find nodes that can be linked across layers
  * find out if nodes can share exactly the same coordinates
* figure out how to link layers. Create a new aggregate graph?

* Path creator (picks two random locations, can copy from BikeNetworks)

* See if networkx's built in navigation to find closest nodes will sum up distance and potentially also mph. At least it needs to return the nodes that comprise the path from one location to another
