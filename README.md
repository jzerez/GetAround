# GetAround
An investigation on the efficacy on personal electric vehicles to commuting in urban environments

## Installation
This project uses [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx), which is a huge pain to install without conda. If you _do_ have conda installed, you can just make an environment with the following command

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
